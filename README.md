# PAINT-F1-site

The idea behind the project is to allow for easy access to information about the current season of Formula 1, as well as some basic information about the drivers.

The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is used as a base/frame and navigation, CSS for the small amount of styling and JavaScript to fetch data from the Ergast API and injecting it into the HMTL elements.

It consists of the following parts:
- **The Home Screen**- this is where the user is returned upon clicking the house icon on other pages. There are links to current standings as well as a calendar marking the already completed races with links to the results, the next race as well as all future races.

- **The Current Standings Screens**- tables showing the current amount of points and wins for drivers and constructors.

- **The Race Result Screen**- Title showing the chosen grand prix and a table with the result, showing positions, status and points awarded for the race.

- **The Driver Screen**- Page with basic information about the driver as well as an attached photo sourced from the project files.

Clicking on a chosen driver in standings/results brings the user to the Driver Page. Clicking on a chosen constructor, or a chosen driver in the Driver Page redirects the user to their page on Wikipedia.
In the tables next to the constructors' names their logos have been added.
